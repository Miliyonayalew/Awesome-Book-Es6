# Awesome-Book-Es6
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microverse-blueviolet)

This project is where I restructured the code for my Awesome Books app. code. The goal is to make it more organized by using modules. And to create  ES6 syntax that I have learned. 
"Awesome books" is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list. By building this application, I learn how to manage data using JavaScript, how to use modules and ES6.

## Built With
